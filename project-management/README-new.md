- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL + Redis (planned)
- **Tools**: Docker, Jest, ESLint, CI/CD pipeline

## 🏗️ Project Management Structure (Macro/Micro)

### MACRO Level (Project Management)
```
project-management/
├── assignments/           # Role-based macro assignments
├── strategy/             # High-level project strategy
├── releases/             # Release planning and tracking
├── epics/                # High-level feature epics
├── docs/                 # Project documentation
├── archive/              # Archived/obsolete files
├── CONTROL-FRAMEWORK.md  # Macro/micro hierarchy definition
└── PROJECT-DASHBOARD.md  # Executive project overview
```

### MICRO Level (Role Workspaces)
```
../backend/               # Backend developer workspace
../frontend/              # Frontend developer workspace
../qa/                    # QA engineer workspace
../devops/                # DevOps engineer workspace
```

## 🎭 Solo Developer Role-Based System

The project uses a **macro/micro hierarchy** where:

- **Project Management (MACRO)**: Controls high-level assignments, strategic direction, and cross-role coordination
- **Role Workspaces (MICRO)**: Individual roles manage detailed implementation tasks with full autonomy

### Available Roles:
- **Frontend Developer**: UI/UX, React components, styling, accessibility
- **Backend Developer**: APIs, database, server logic, security
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, quality assurance, automation, validation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure, CI/CD

## 🔄 Solo Developer Workflow

1. **Project Management Role**: Create macro-level assignments in `assignments/`
2. **Switch to Role**: Move to appropriate role workspace (backend/frontend/qa/devops)
3. **Implement Tasks**: Break down assignments into detailed tasks and execute
4. **Report Progress**: Update assignment status and escalate blockers to Project Management
5. **Repeat**: Continue cycle with different roles as needed
