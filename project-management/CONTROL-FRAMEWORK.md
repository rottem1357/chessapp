# Project Management Control Framework

## 🎯 Project Management Hierarchy

**Project Management operates at the MACRO level:**
- **WHAT** needs to be delivered
- **WHEN** it should be completed  
- **WHY** it's important
- **WHO** (which role) should deliver it

**Individual Roles operate at the MICRO level:**
- **HOW** to implement the requirements
- **WHICH** specific tasks to create
- **WHAT** tools and methods to use
- **HOW** to organize their work

## 📋 Assignment Distribution Process

### 1. **Project Management Creates Assignments**
Project management creates **macro-level assignments** for each role:

```
ASSIGNMENT: User Authentication System
ASSIGNED TO: Backend Role
DELIVERABLES: 
- Secure JWT-based authentication API
- User registration and login endpoints  
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- API responds within 200ms
- Supports 1000+ concurrent users
- Passes security audit
- 90%+ test coverage
DUE DATE: July 26, 2025
PRIORITY: High
```

### 2. **Role-Specific Task Creation**
Each role then creates their **micro-level tasks** in their own workspace:

**Backend Role** creates detailed tasks:
- Research JWT libraries
- Design database schema
- Implement password hashing
- Create API endpoints
- Write unit tests
- Set up integration tests
- Performance optimization
- Security review

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
- **Project Management** tracks: "Authentication System - 70% complete"
- **Backend Role** tracks: "15 of 20 technical tasks completed"

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### Assignment Creation (Project Management)
1. **Create Assignment**: Define what needs to be delivered
2. **Set Acceptance Criteria**: Define success metrics
3. **Assign to Role**: Specify which role is responsible
4. **Set Timeline**: Define deadlines and milestones
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor deliverable completion

### Task Creation (Individual Roles)
1. **Review Assignment**: Understand requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Create Specification**: Break down into technical tasks
3. **Plan Implementation**: Organize work and set priorities
4. **Execute Tasks**: Complete the micro-level work
5. **Report Progress**: Update macro-level progress

### Integration Points
- **Daily Check-ins**: Role progress updates to project management
- **Weekly Reviews**: Deliverable status and blocker identification
- **Sprint Planning**: New assignments and priority updates
- **Milestone Reviews**: Deliverable acceptance and quality validation

## 📊 Control Mechanisms

### Project Management Dashboard
- **Deliverable Status**: What's been delivered vs. what's planned
- **Role Performance**: Each role's delivery track record
- **Dependency Issues**: Blockers between roles
- **Timeline Adherence**: On-time delivery metrics

### Role Autonomy
- **Technical Decisions**: Roles decide implementation details
- **Task Management**: Roles manage their own task breakdown
- **Tool Selection**: Roles choose their preferred tools
- **Work Organization**: Roles organize their work as needed

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clear Separation**: Macro control vs. micro execution
2. **Role Autonomy**: Each role manages their own work style
3. **Accountability**: Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles or expand teams
5. **Focus**: Project management stays strategic, roles stay tactical

What do you think about this structure? Should we implement this hierarchy with separate folders for each role's micro-level task management?
