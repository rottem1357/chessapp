## 🎭 Solo Developer Role-Based Task Management

The project uses a role-based task management system where you switch between different developer roles:

- **Frontend Developer**: UI/UX, React components, styling, accessibility
- **Backend Developer**: APIs, database, server logic, security
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, quality assurance, automation, validation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure, CI/CD

Each role has dedicated task files and focuses, allowing for comprehensive coverage of all development aspects while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

See the `task-distribution/` directory for role-specific task management.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Strategic Planning**: Define epics and releases in `strategy/` and `releases/`
2. **Task Distribution**: Break down epics into frontend/backend tasks
3. **Development**: Teams work on assigned tasks from their respective files
4. **Integration**: Coordinate shared tasks and testing
5. **Release**: Complete release milestones and archive completed items
