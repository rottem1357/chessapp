# Feature: Game Analysis Tools

## Feature: Post-Game Analysis and Review

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Backlog  
**Estimated Effort:** Large  
**Assigned To:** TBD

### Description
Provide comprehensive game analysis tools that use Stockfish to evaluate moves, show accuracy statistics, highlight mistakes, and offer improvement suggestions.

### User Story
As a chess player, I want to analyze my completed games to understand my mistakes and improve my play.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic analysis of completed games
