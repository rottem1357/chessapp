## Feature: Real-Time Multiplayer Chess

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Backlog  
**Estimated Effort:** Large  
**Assigned To:** TBD

### Description
Enable users to play real-time chess games with other players online, supporting various time controls (bullet, blitz, rapid, daily) and both rated and unrated games.

### User Story
As a chess player, I want to play live games against other players online so that I can enjoy competitive chess matches in real-time.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Players can create and join game rooms
- [ ] Real-time move synchronization between players
- [ ] Support for different time controls (bullet, blitz, rapid, daily)
- [ ] Game clock functionality with accurate timing
- [ ] Rated and unrated game options
- [ ] Matchmaking system for finding opponents
- [ ] Handle disconnections and reconnections gracefully
- [ ] Draw offers and resignation functionality

### Technical Requirements
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Game room management system
- User session persistence
- Move validation on both client and server
- Timer synchronization
- Database storage for game state

### UI/UX Considerations
- Clear indication of whose turn it is
- Visible game clocks
- Smooth piece movement animations
- Connection status indicators
- Game controls (resign, offer draw, etc.)

### Implementation Notes
- Use Socket.IO rooms for game sessions
- Implement Redis for session persistence
- Server-side move validation using chess.js
- Handle edge cases like network interruptions
- Files to modify: backend/server.js, frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.js

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for game logic
- [ ] Integration tests for Socket.IO communication
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent games
- [ ] User acceptance testing for game flow

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Two players can successfully play a complete game
- [ ] All time controls work correctly
- [ ] Game state persists through disconnections
- [ ] Move validation prevents cheating
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback for all game states
