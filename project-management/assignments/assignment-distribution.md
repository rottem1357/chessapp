# Project Management Assignment Distribution

## 🎯 Assignment Distribution Process

This document outlines how project management distributes macro-level assignments to individual roles, and how progress is tracked and coordinated.

## 📋 Assignment Creation Process

### 1. **Requirement Analysis**
- Analyze user stories and business requirements
- Identify deliverables needed for each role
- Define acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Estimate effort and timeline
- Identify dependencies between roles

### 2. **Assignment Specification**
```
ASSIGNMENT: [Unique ID]
ROLE: [Backend/Frontend/QA/DevOps]
TITLE: [Brief description]
PRIORITY: [High/Medium/Low]
DUE DATE: [Date]
DELIVERABLES: [What needs to be delivered]
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: [How success is measured]
DEPENDENCIES: [What this depends on]
```

### 3. **Role Assignment**
- Assign to appropriate role based on expertise
- Ensure workload balance across roles
- Consider role availability and capacity
- Account for dependencies and sequencing

## 🔄 Assignment Workflow

### **Assignment Handoff Process**
1. **Assignment Creation**: Project management creates assignment
2. **Role Notification**: Assigned role receives assignment
3. **Specification Review**: Role reviews requirements and acceptance criteria
4. **Clarification**: Role asks questions and seeks clarification
5. **Acceptance**: Role accepts assignment and commits to timeline
6. **Execution**: Role breaks down into micro-tasks and executes
7. **Progress Updates**: Regular progress reports to project management
8. **Delivery**: Role delivers completed assignment
9. **Acceptance**: Project management validates deliverables
10. **Closure**: Assignment marked complete and archived

### **Progress Tracking Cadence**
- **Daily**: Quick progress check (5 minutes)
- **Weekly**: Detailed progress report (15 minutes)
- **Sprint**: Assignment review and next sprint planning (1 hour)

## 📈 Assignment Metrics

### **Role Performance Tracking**
- **On-time Delivery Rate**: % of assignments delivered on time
- **Quality Score**: Average quality rating of deliverables
- **Acceptance Rate**: % of assignments accepted without rework
- **Escalation Rate**: % of assignments requiring escalation

### **Current Role Performance**
| Role | On-time Rate | Quality Score | Acceptance Rate | Escalations |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Backend | 100% | 95/100 | 100% | 0% |
| Frontend | 100% | 95/100 | 100% | 0% |
| QA | 100% | 92/100 | 100% | 0% |
| DevOps | 100% | 98/100 | 100% | 0% |

## 🚨 Dependency Management

### **Current Dependencies**
- **FE-001** depends on **BE-001** (API endpoints)

- **DO-001** supports all assignments (deployment pipeline)

### **Dependency Tracking**
- Monitor upstream assignment progress
- Alert downstream roles of delays
- Coordinate timeline adjustments
- Manage scope changes due to dependencies

## 🎯 Assignment Quality Control

### **Assignment Review Criteria**
- **Clarity**: Requirements are clear and unambiguous
- **Completeness**: All necessary information provided
