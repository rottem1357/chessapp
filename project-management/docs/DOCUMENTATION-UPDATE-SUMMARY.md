- **`assignment-distribution.md`**: Updated assignment progress and corrected assignment titles
- **`qa-assignments.md`**: Created comprehensive QA assignment tracking
- **`devops-assignments.md`**: Created comprehensive DevOps assignment tracking

### 📦 **Files Archived** (moved to `archive/`)
- **`communication-framework.md`**: Team-based communication (not applicable to solo developer)
- **`quality-assurance-framework.md`**: Team-based QA processes (QA role has own workspace)
- **`governance.md`**: Team-based governance structure (not applicable to solo developer)
- **`change-management.md`**: Team-based change management (not applicable to solo developer)
- **`metrics-dashboard.md`**: Team-based metrics (not applicable to solo developer)
- **`risk-management.md`**: Team-based risk management (not applicable to solo developer)

### 🔄 **Files Maintained**
- **`conventions.md`**: Naming conventions (updated for new structure)
- **`technical-debt.md`**: Technical debt tracking (updated for role-based ownership)
- **`project-health-monitor.md`**: Project health monitoring (updated for role performance)
- **`workflow.md`**: Development workflow (completely rewritten for macro/micro)
- **`templates/`**: Document templates (still relevant)
- **`backend-assignments.md`**: Backend role assignments (maintained)
- **`frontend-assignments.md`**: Frontend role assignments (maintained)
- **`assignment-distribution.md`**: Assignment tracking and distribution (updated)

## 🏗️ **New Structure Summary**

### MACRO Level (Project Management)
- **Strategic documents**: `strategy/`, `epics/`, `releases/`
- **Assignment management**: `assignments/` directory
- **Cross-role coordination**: `PROJECT-DASHBOARD.md`, `CONTROL-FRAMEWORK.md`

### MICRO Level (Role Workspaces)
- **Backend**: `../backend/` directory with tasks, API specs, database, testing
- **Frontend**: `../frontend/` directory with tasks, components, designs, testing
- **QA**: `../qa/` directory with tasks, test plans, automation, reports
- **DevOps**: `../devops/` directory with tasks, infrastructure, deployment, monitoring

## 📊 **Impact**

### ✅ **Benefits**
- **Clear separation**: Macro strategic control vs micro implementation autonomy
- **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated team-based processes for solo developer
- **Focused workspaces**: Each role has dedicated workspace with relevant tools
- **Streamlined workflow**: Assignment-based development cycle

### 🔄 **Process Changes**
- **Assignment-driven**: Work flows through role-based assignments
- **Role switching**: Clear context switching between strategic and implementation
- **Autonomous implementation**: Roles have full control over technical decisions
- **Minimal overhead**: Focus on deliverables rather than process

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. **Role workspaces**: Continue developing role-specific task management
2. **Assignment system**: Refine assignment creation and tracking processes
3. **Metrics adaptation**: Develop solo developer-focused metrics
4. **Documentation maintenance**: Keep docs updated as system evolves
