# Solo Developer Workflow Guide

## üîÑ Development Workflow

This guide outlines the streamlined development workflow for the Chess App project as a solo developer using the **macro/micro hierarchy** approach.

## üèóÔ∏è Macro/Micro Architecture

### MACRO Level (Project Management)
- **Strategic Control**: High-level project direction and coordination
- **Assignment Creation**: Defines what needs to be done, not how
- **Cross-Role Coordination**: Ensures alignment between roles
- **Quality Gates**: Establishes acceptance criteria and deliverables

### MICRO Level (Role Workspaces)
- **Implementation Details**: How tasks are executed technically
- **Task Breakdown**: Detailed implementation steps
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture and technology choices
- **Progress Tracking**: Day-to-day task management

## üìã Project Management Process

### 1. Strategic Planning (MACRO)
- **Frequency**: Weekly review, monthly deep dive
- **Focus**: Feature prioritization, technical roadmap
- **Deliverables**: Updated roadmap, next sprint planning
- **Location**: `strategy/` directory

### 2. Assignment Creation (MACRO)
- **Frequency**: Per sprint cycle (every 2 weeks)
- **Focus**: Convert strategic goals into role-based assignments
- **Deliverables**: Role assignments with acceptance criteria
- **Location**: `assignments/` directory

### 3. Role Implementation (MICRO)
- **Frequency**: Daily execution
- **Focus**: Detailed task implementation and technical execution
- **Deliverables**: Working features meeting assignment criteria
- **Location**: `../backend/`, `../frontend/`, `../qa/`, `../devops/` directories

### 4. Progress Coordination (MACRO)
- **Frequency**: Weekly review, daily check-ins
- **Focus**: Cross-role coordination and dependency management
- **Deliverables**: Status updates, blocker resolution
- **Location**: Assignment progress tracking

## üéØ Solo Developer Workflow

### Assignment-Based Development Cycle
1. **Project Management Role (MACRO)**

   - Create macro-level assignments for each role
   - Define acceptance criteria and deliverables
   - Set priorities and timelines

2. **Role Switch to Implementation (MICRO)**
   - Move to appropriate role workspace (`../backend/`, `../frontend/`, etc.)
   - Break down assignment into detailed implementation tasks
   - Execute tasks with full technical autonomy
   - Track progress in role-specific task files

3. **Progress Reporting (MACRO)**
   - Switch back to Project Management role
   - Review progress across all roles
   - Identify and resolve cross-role dependencies
   - Update assignment status and metrics

4. **Cycle Continuation**
   - Continue with next priority role or assignment
   - Maintain separation between macro and micro concerns
   - Focus on deliverables rather than process overhead

### Daily Workflow (Role-Based)
1. **Morning Planning (Project Management)**
   - Review assignment progress across all roles
   - Identify highest priority role for the day
