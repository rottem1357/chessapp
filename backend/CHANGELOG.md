### ✨ Major Refactoring - Complete Backend Restructure

This release represents a complete refactoring and restructuring of the backend codebase for better maintainability, scalability, and developer experience.

#### 🏗️ **Architecture Changes**
- **Modular Structure**: Reorganized code into logical modules (controllers, services, middleware, utils)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between HTTP handling, business logic, and data management
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration system with environment-based settings
- **Error Handling**: Implemented centralized error handling with consistent response formats

#### 📁 **New Directory Structure**
```

├── controllers/      # HTTP request handlers  
├── middleware/       # Express middleware
├── routes/          # API route definitions
├── services/        # Business logic services
├── utils/           # Utility functions and constants
├── docs/            # Documentation
├── tests/           # Test files
└── server.js        # Main entry point
```

#### 🆕 **New Features**
- **Enhanced AI Service**: Improved AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels
- **Game Service**: Comprehensive multiplayer game management
- **Socket Service**: Dedicated WebSocket communication handling
- **Request Logging**: Structured logging for development and debugging
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation middleware
- **Health Checks**: Server health monitoring endpoints
- **Game Statistics**: API endpoints for game statistics

#### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- **Async/Await**: Migrated from callbacks to modern async/await patterns
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling with async wrapper middleware
- **Type Safety**: Better input validation and type checking
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old games and AI sessions
- **Performance**: Optimized game state management and AI algorithms

#### 📚 **Documentation**
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **Development Guide**: Detailed guide for developers
- **Code Comments**: Extensive inline documentation
- **README**: Updated project documentation

#### 🧪 **Testing**
- **Test Framework**: Set up Jest testing framework
- **API Tests**: Basic API endpoint testing
- **Test Configuration**: Jest configuration for coverage reporting

#### 🛠️ **Developer Experience**
- **Environment Configuration**: Comprehensive environment variable setup
- **Development Scripts**: New npm scripts for development workflow
- **Code Organization**: Logical file organization for easy navigation
- **Constants Management**: Centralized constants for consistency

#### 🔄 **Backwards Compatibility**
- **API Compatibility**: Maintained existing API endpoint compatibility
- **Socket Events**: Preserved existing WebSocket event structure
- **Game Logic**: Core chess game logic remains unchanged

#### 🗑️ **Removed/Deprecated**
